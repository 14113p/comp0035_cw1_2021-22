# Coursework 2

Most students will use the same repository for coursework 2. You may use this file to present the results of that
coursework if you wish. Alternatively you can use video or audio to provide the explanations instead of writing them.

## Requirements definition and analysis

### Requirements identification methods
brainstorming/observation of similar applications
As while working on this project I could not gather information from other people (either potential users or other non-existent developers) I had to rely on my own ideas and experience.

### Requirement specification method
user stories
### Prioritisation method
MoSCoW technique
### Documented and prioritised requirements
[Requirements file](design_requirements.md)


## Design
### Structure and flow of the interface

### Relational database design

### Application structure


## Testing
### Choice of unit testing library

### Tests
The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

### Test results
Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

### Continuous integration (optional)
Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.
