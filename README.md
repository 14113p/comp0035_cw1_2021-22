# Coursework 2

## Requirements definition and analysis

### Requirements identification methods
brainstorming/observation of similar applications
As while working on this project I could not gather information from other people (either potential users or other non-existent developers) I had to rely on my own ideas and experience.
### Requirement specification method
user stories
### Prioritisation method
MoSCoW technique
### Documented and prioritised requirements
[Requirements file](design_requirements.md)

## Design

### Structure and flow of the interface
[Wireframes](design\wireframes)
[User Flows](design\user_flows.png)
### Relational database design
[Database design](design\db_design.png)
### Application structure
[ERD](design\er_diagram.png)
[UML Class Diagram](design\class_diagram.png)
[Deployment Diagram](design\deployment_diagram.png)

*All the wireframes were created using the [Moqups](https://moqups.com) service <br/>
Other software used for the design stage: [Lucid Chart](https://lucidchart.com), [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com)

## Testing
### Choice of unit testing library
pytest
### Tests
[Test File](test\test_user.py)
### Test results
[Proof](proof_of_testing.png)

### Continuous integration (optional)
Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.

## Weekly progress reports

### Report 1
What I did in the last week:
- created some initial user stories
- had an initial attempt of sketching wireframes (not final)

What I plan to do in the next week:
- create more user stories
- finalize and digitalize the wireframes (at least the early-stage ones)

Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):
- temporarily lost access to my coursework file (github has an older version, should recover it before next week)

### Report 2
What I did in the last week:
- initial version of the user flows
- most of the planned wireframes
- further user stories

What I plan to do in the next week:
- UML diagrams
- review project's direction and the progress so far

Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):
- None

### Report 3
What I did in the last week:
- UML Class diagram
- UML deployment diagram

What I plan to do in the next week:
- approach testing and database design

Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):
- None

### Report 4
What I did in the last week:
- ER diagram
- designed tests

What I plan to do in the next week:
- debug and run tests

Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):
- buggs while attempting to test
- Complications of personal nature
