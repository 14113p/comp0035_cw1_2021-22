## Selection of project methodology
### Methodology (or combination) selected
Scrum/TDSP

### Selection criteria and justification of selection
I have chosen this methodology as I already have some experience with Scrum, however as it is a also a data science project I would like to merge it with TDSP, for the benefit of both the project and my knowledge.
I am also yet to decide the course of the project, so choosing an Agile methodology would allow me to work in small increments and change my plans on the fly if needed so. I am also relatively inexperienced when it comes to bigger projects so it would be nice to have a quantifiable progress in order to stay motivated and organised.

## Definition of the business need
### Problem definition
    The purpose is to investgate the relationship between movie's commercial/critical success and other variables such as length, genre, budget.
    The app will serve as a market understanding tool and a reference point in popculture discussions
### Target audience
    Movie Journalists,
    Filmmakers looking for commercial success,
    Normal people for entertainment/curiosity purposes
### Questions to be answered using the dataset
    Is there a common attribute that the most succesful movies share?
    How does the film's popularity change over time?
